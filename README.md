# Coffee_machine
The coffee machine described in the code is a program that simulates a coffee vending machine. It allows users to select from three different types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. 

1. Users can make a selection by entering the name of the desired coffee or request a report to see the current status of the machine. 
2. When a coffee is selected, the machine checks if there are sufficient resources (water, milk, and coffee) available to make the chosen coffee. 
3. If the resources are available, the machine calculates the cost of the coffee and prompts the user to insert the required coins. 
4. If the inserted money matches the cost, the machine dispenses the coffee and completes the transaction. 
5. If the inserted money exceeds the cost, the machine provides change and dispenses the coffee. 
6. If the inserted money is insufficient, the machine refunds the money. 

Additionally, the machine keeps track of the total money earned and deducts the used resources from the available resources. Users can request a report to see the total money earned, remaining resources, and any deducted resources for previous transactions.
